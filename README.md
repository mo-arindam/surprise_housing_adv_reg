## General Information
- A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market
- The comapny wants to buy undervalued properties to resell for profit.
- They want to use Data analytics to predict property values
- Data: Australian house sale data (provided as CSV file)
- Task: Build a regression model to predict the actual value of prospective properties.
<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- The final Lasso regression model, after excluding the initial top predictors, identified 1stFlrSF, YearBuilt, YearRemodAdd, FullBath, and TotRmsAbvGrd as the most important predictors for determining house prices. This model provides a reliable framework for predicting house prices and making informed real estate decisions.
